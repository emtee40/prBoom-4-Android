**PrBoom4Android is a port of the open source PrBoom Doom engine. It was originally ported to android by Vladimir Silva when the first android device, the G1, was released. Since the original port was designed to work with the G1's hardware keyboard, it did not function with touchscreen only devices.**

**This release adds on-screen multitouch controls to support newer devices. If you have a hardware keyboard, you can always use that or enable the touch controls, the choice is your!**
